# BLKI_DLW_methods
 This repository will be used to store all necessary information and data of a project completed in the context of the Productivity and Reproducibility
 in Ecology and Evolution course. The project will focus on assessing the impact of the two-sample method when using doubly-labelled water (DLW) in 
 free-ranging black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). The data used was collected by Fred Tremblay (author of repository) on Middleton Island, AK, 
 in the summer of 2021.


This project is being reviewed by Kate Sheridan
